talk-title: 'LiveCode: Microservices (Azure Service Fabric)'
talk-description: |
  This session will cover the agnostic nature of Microservices. As each service is independent and each service is a new project, each service can be developed in any language that is best fits for the requirement. Microservices will be built in both Java and C# in a single application.
