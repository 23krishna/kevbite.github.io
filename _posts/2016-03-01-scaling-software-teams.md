# It's Hard, It's Happens, It's Normal

Within a normal environment it's inevitable for software teams to grow. Businesses and clients want more features and they want them faster. The delivery proccess can only be optimised up to a given point so hiring more people is necessary.

Hiring people can be a slick process. From day one the new employee should fit straight into their role like a square peg fitting in to that square hole. However I've also been at places where it's a rocky road from day one, and you just seem to be stuck in a rutt and it's impossible to delivery anything of any business value. I guess this post is more about the contrasts of the good and bad that I've seen.

# Prematurely Splitting Teams

Like software, prematurely trying to optimise teams by splitting teams up from day one never seem to very efficent. Your goal as a whole team should be aligned so splitting teams off, for example an API and UI team, seems to result in each team deflecting issues to the opposite team. The team should work to a fully deliverable product.

## One Team

Working as one team allows a lot more knowledge sharing and thus there is a much better understanding of the product and technology. I'm not a firm believer of a _Full stack developer_, I believe more of a _T shaped developer_. I have found that individuals have core skills in few areas but know the basics of a lot of other skills. But that is why we work as a team, no has the ability or time to do everything. I also find allowing your primarily back-end developers to understand the usage of how something works on the user interface allows them to make better design decisions, this works in all directions from initial user interface designed to deployment.

Sticking at one team is not going to last forever, imagine having a planning meeting with 30 developers, It would just be a waste of money. I'd strive to keep at one team until everyday tasks start becoming a grind.

# Multiple Teams

If you're expanding and are required to deliver more and your going to have to split off in to different teams
