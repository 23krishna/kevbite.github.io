You might have noticed on twitter recently that people are tweeting that they've found a GitHub secret.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ðŸ”’&quot;You found a secret!&quot;<br><br>Apparently `yourhandle/yourhandle` is a âœ¨special âœ¨ repository that you can use to add a <a href="https://t.co/vN1U0KwWlX">https://t.co/vN1U0KwWlX</a> to your GitHub profile. ðŸ¤­ <a href="https://t.co/60MQs0GagT">pic.twitter.com/60MQs0GagT</a></p>&mdash; /dev/caneco (@Caneco) <a href="https://twitter.com/Caneco/status/1279434881253154817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Let's explore creating this secret, and see what it entails!

## Creating the Repository

To start off with we need to head over to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) to create a new repository, the trick here is to have the _Repository name_ the same as the _Owner_. In my case my owner is `kevbite` so my repository name is `kevbite`. Once you've got the name correct you'll get a informational message telling you this is a special repository.

## Editing the Readme

Once the repository is created you'll be presented with your `README.md` file which contains a sample message of 

> Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here is we click the green _Edit README_ button we can change what our readme says.

Once you're in the edit file page you can start to edit your own readme file, note that this file is markdown so you can use lots of different styling and even images. Here you can see that I've created a few markdown hyperlinks.

There's loads of [Markdown Cheatsheets](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) on the internet to help you write markdown, you can even use [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown).

Once we're happy with our readme file we can preview what it looks like before saving it.

Once we've saved the file, go back to your profile overview and you'll see you're lovely new readme!
