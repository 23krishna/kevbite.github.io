talk-title: April Remote Kata Meetup
talk-description: |
  This was a hands-on mobbing kata via VS Live Share, This was all online due to COVID-19, however, we ran this the same as our in person events where we each wrote a test and pass the control around the table for people to have a go at making the test pass.

  On the night of the event we decided to do the Game of Life kata.
