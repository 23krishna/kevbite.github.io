talk-title: A more flexible way to store your data with MongoDB
talk-description: |
  If you've been anywhere near software development, the norm is to store your data in a relational form, but what if there was a better way?
  We will take a look at the history of MongoDB and why it continues to be a trending database year on year. We will then go in to the advantages of having a flexible document model and how we can utilise MongoDB for our application storage.
