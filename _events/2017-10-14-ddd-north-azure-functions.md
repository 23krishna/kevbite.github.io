talk-title: Building APIs with Azure Functions
talk-description: |
  Functions as a Service (FaaS) seems to be trending as the next big buzzword, in this session we'll look at the advantages of using FaaS and how we can take advantage of Azure Functions to build our APIs. Through this demo lead session we'll see examples of how we can take advantage of HttpTriggers, Routing, Proxies and API definition to build a set of rich functions as the source for our APIs.
